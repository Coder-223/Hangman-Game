# Hangman-Game
Created April 9, 2024 by Michael Pancras

Welcome to Hangman! This is a rendition of the classic word-guessing game where you have to figure out the hidden word before running out of attempts.

The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and displays it as blank spaces, representing each letter. You need to guess letters one by one. If the guessed letter is in the word, it reveals its position(s); otherwise, you accumulate strikes.

You have a maximum of 8 strikes before the game ends. If you fail to guess the word within the given attempts, the game ends, revealing the correct word.

If you successfully guess the word, congratulations! You win the game. You can choose to play again or exit the game.

Enjoy playing Hangman!
